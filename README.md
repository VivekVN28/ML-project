## End to End machine learning project

Project Overview

This project demonstrates the complete lifecycle of an end-to-end machine learning pipeline using the Kaggle Student Performance dataset. The objective is to build, evaluate, and compare multiple machine learning models while following production-oriented best practices such as modular pipeline design, structured logging, and robust error handling.


The project is organized into clearly defined stages:

1. Data Ingestion
2. Data Transformation
3. Model Training & Evaluation
4. Logging & Error Handling
